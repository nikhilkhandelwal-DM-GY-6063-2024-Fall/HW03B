# HW03-B

**This is a submission of Homework for Week 3 Part B.**

In this homework I tried to create a rotational geometric spiral pattern using squares. 

 It features alternating black and white squares, gradually rotating and scaling down toward the center. 
 
 This type of design is known for its visual appeal, and it's commonly used in abstract or optical art to create the illusion of movement and depth.
